**PNHTagTest** is a compilation of partial HTML documents intended to allow for a quick review of styling of common markup patterns in a CMS or other website project.

### Overview

Each file contains similar passages of content marked up with a variety of HTML elements (`h1`, `p`, `blockquote`, `table`) in a variety of scenarios (word wrapping, nested lists, links in headings). These partial HTML documents are intended to be dropped into the content area of a new projects site's templates (copy+pasted in HTML files, included via SSI or other method, or added as a test article or blog post in a CMS) and used as a quick resource for styling elements that may not have been captured in design comps, for checking readability of the base site styling and early review and QA tasks.

This is not a strict linear inventory of elements, but rather a mix of elements and markup scenarios that allow for review of cases so that you can evaluate the typography, margins and other styles when elements wrap, nest, or come before or after other types of elements.
