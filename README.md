These are passages of content marked up with a variety of HTML elements (h1, p, blockquote, table) in a variety of scenarios (word wrapping, nested lists, links in headings). The files are intended to be dropped into the content area of a site's templates (included or copy+pasted in HTML files or added as a test article or post in a CMS) and used as a quick resource for styling elements that may not have been captured in design comps, for checking readability of the base site styling and early review and QA tasks.
